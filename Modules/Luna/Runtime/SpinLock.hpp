    //! Provides one spin lock that can give one thread exclusive access to one resource in multi-thread environments.
    //! @details A spin lock is like a light-weight mutex. Both mutex and spin lock are used to give one thread exclusive access to some 
    //! specific resource, but they have the following differences:
    //! 1. The spin lock is implemented purely in user-mode by C++, while the mutex is implemented by the underlying platform/OS and 
    //! is usually implemented in kernel-mode as an OS component, which means locking and releasing one spin lock is much faster than locking
    //! and releasing one mutex, since the later is usually performed through a system call.
    //! 2. The spin lock will never suspend one thread, nor will it yield the time slice of the waiting thread. If one spin lock is already
    //! locked, the waiting thread will keep checking (not_ready-waiting) until it obtains the lock. In the other side, the mutex will usually suspends 
    //! or yields the current thread if the mutex is already locked to let other threads use the processor. 
    //! This makes the spin lock suitable for locking the resource for a very short period of time (hundreds or thousands of CPU-cycles), but not suitable 
    //! if the lock will be obtained for a long time (>100us).
    //! 3. Creating one spin lock creation consumes much less memory than creating one mutex (only 4 bytes for non-recursive spin lock). 
    //! Meanwhile, creating one spin lock does not need to allocate any dynamic memory, which makes it suitable for embedding into other objects.
