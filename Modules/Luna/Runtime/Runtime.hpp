    //! Initializes Luna SDK.
    //! @details Call this function to initialize Luna SDK. Most features provided by Luna SDK are only available after Luna SDK is initialized, 
    //! so always initialize Luna SDK firstly on program startup. Calling this function when Luna SDK is already initialized does nothing and returns `true` directly.
    //! 
    //! Note that modules registered to Luna SDK will not be initialized by this function, they should be initialized manually using functions like @ref init_modules.
    //! @return Returns `true` if Luna SDK is succssfully initialized, returns `false` otherwise.
    LUNA_RUNTIME_API bool init();

    //! Closes Luna SDK.
    //! @details Call this function to close Luna SDK. Most features provided by Luna SDK are not available after Luna SDK is closed.
    //! Calling this function when Luna SDK is not initialized or already closed does nothing and returns directly.
    //! 
    //! Initialized modules *will* be closed by this function in the reverse order of their initialization order, so they don't need to be closed manually.
    //! @remark All dynamic memory allocated from @ref memalloc, @ref memrealloc and @ref memnew must be freed before calling @ref close,
    //! all boxed objects created from @ref new_object and @ref object_alloc must be released before calling @ref close too. 
    //! Calls to @ref memfree, @ref memdelete, @ref object_release and other functions after @ref close results in undefined behavior, and usually a program crash. 
    //! This often happens when you declare global variables that hold dynamic allocated resources (such as @ref Ref) and memory blocks (such as @ref UniquePtr, 
    //! and containers like @ref Vector, @ref HashMap, etc.). Remember to clear such resources before calling @ref close. For some containers, you should call 
    //! `clear` then `shrink_to_fit` to eventually frees the internal memory buffer used by containers.
