    //! transferred to write mode by acquiring write ownership of the lock. When the read write lock is in read mode, successing acquires of read ownership
    //! succeeds, but acquires of write ownership will fail or be blocked until all read ownerships are released; When the read write lock is in write mode,
    //! all succeeding acquires of read and write ownerships will fail or be blocked until the write ownership is released. The write ownership is not recursive:
    //! succeeding acquire of write ownership from the thread that already acquired the write ownership causes deadlock and shall not be performed.
