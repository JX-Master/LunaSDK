        //! Represents a synchronization object that can be used to synchronize commands executed in different command queues.
        //! @details A fence is a synchronization primitive that can be used to insert a dependency between queue operations. 
        //! When the user submits one queue operation, she may specify multiple fences as either wait targets or signal targets. 
        //! Before the device processes the operation, it will firstly waits for all wait targets to be signaled. After the device 
        //! processes the operation, it will signal all signal targets, so that other operations waiting on these fences can be 
        //! processed.
        //! 
        //! Every fence has two states: signaled and unsignaled. The fence state is managed by the device automatically, 
        //! one fence is created in unsignaled state, every signal operation changes the fence state from unsignaled to 
        //! signaled, and every wait operation resets the fence state to unsignaled. To use fence objects properly,
        //! the user must ensure that signal operations and wait operations on the same fence should occur in discrete 1:1 pairs 
        //! (every two signal operations should have one wait operations in between, every two wait operations should one signal 
        //! operations in between).
