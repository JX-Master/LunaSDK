        //! Specify the memory type. See remarks for details.
        //! @remark The memory type determines the memory location and access policy for the memory.
        //! The system will choose the most suitable heap to allocate memory based on the target platform 
        //! and the specified memory type.
        //! 
        //! The local memory type is allocated on memory that is visible only to GPU. Such memory gains maximum 
        //! GPU bandwidth, but cannot be accessed by CPU. On platforms with non-uniform memory architecture (NUMA),
        //! the local memory will be allocated on video memory, which cannot be accessed by CPU; in a platform with 
        //! uniform memory architecture (UMA), the local memory will be allocated on system memory. While it is 
        //! technically possible for CPU to access local memory on UMA, preventing such access gives the hardware and
        //! driver more rooms for optimizing GPU access efficiency.
        //!
        //! The upload memory type is allocated on system memory that is optimized for CPU writing. GPU cannot write to this memory and
        //! GPU reading from upload memory is slow. On NUMA platfroms, reading data from upload memory from GPU requires data transmission 
        //! through PCI-Express bus, which is much slower than reading data in local memory from GPU. We recommend using upload memory only 
        //! for uploading data to local memory or reading the data only once per CPU write.
        //! 
        //! The readback memory type is allocated on system memory that is optimized for CPU reading. GPU writing to read back memory 
        //! is slow, and the only operation allowed for GPU is to copy data to the memory. On NUMA platfroms, writing data to readback memory 
        //! from GPU requires data transmission through PCI-Express bus, which is a slow operation.
        //! 
        //! The user should choose the suitable memory type based on the use situation. Here are some basic principles:
        //! 1. If you need to create texture resources, use local memory. If you need to upload texture data from CPU side, use one upload memory 
        //! to copy data to the local memory.
        //! 2. If you don't need to access resource data from CPU, use local memory.
        //! 3. If you only need to upload data from CPU side once, like setting the initial data for static vertex and index buffers, use 
        //! one local memory to store the data, then use one temporary upload memory to copy data to the local memory.
        //! 4. If you need to upload data from CPU side multiple times, but the data is read by GPU only once per CPU update, use upload memory.
        //! 5. If you need to upload data from CPU side multiple times, and the data will be read by GPU multiple times per CPU update, use one 
        //! local memory resource for GPU access and one upload memory resource for CPU access, and copy data between two resources when needed.
        //! 6. If you need to read resource data from CPU side, use readback memory.
