Use LunaSDK for rendering tasks.
## RHI
RHI (rendering hardware interface) is a abstraction layer of the underlying graphics devices and graphics API. By using RHI, the user can write render codes in a platform-agnostic way. Interfaces of RHI are designed targeting modern graphics APIs, so the application can unleash the full perfomance of modern graphics hardwares by using asynchronous computing, manual synchronization, overlapped memory allocation and other features.
